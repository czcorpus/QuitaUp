Calc: CNC Corpus Calculator
===========================

This repository contains source code for the *Calc* application deployed at [https://www.korpus.cz/calc/][calc].

The only difference between this version and the one used within the [CNC portal][cnc] is the CNC toolbar integration, which has been removed in the github version.

In order to run the source code you'll need several R packages, namely shiny. For playing around we recommend [RStudio][rstudio]. The package version management is done by [packrat][packrat] package.
